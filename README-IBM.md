This repository contains evaluation dataset for targeted sentiment analysis (TSA).
This dataset contains sentences from other datasets that cannot be re-distributed in clear text. 
That's why the included file **tsa_evaluation_hidden.json** contains IDs instead of sentence texts. 

You need to download the resources from the other datasets and run the script that restores the texts as described below.
The resulting file **tsa_evaluation.json** will contain the sentences with annotated targets and sentiments.

The file contains a JSON array of examples, where each example includes the sentence text and a list of targets. 
A target includes the text, its location in the sentence, and the sentiment. 
The sentiment value can be **positive**, **negative**, **mixed**, or **none**.

An example looks like this:
```json
  {
    "text": "Great food but the service was dreadful !",
    "targets": [
      {
        "text": "food",
        "location": {
          "begin": 6,
          "end": 10
        },
        "sentiment": "positive"
      },
      {
        "text": "service",
        "location": {
          "begin": 19,
          "end": 26
        },
        "sentiment": "negative"
      }
    ]
  }
```
